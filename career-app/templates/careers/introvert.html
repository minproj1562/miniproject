        <p>Skills: Proficiency in design software (Adobe Creative Suite), creativity, attention to detail, and communication with clients through visual design rather than verbal.</p>

        <h2>5. Librarian/Archivist</h2>
        <p>Why it's a great fit: Libraries and archives are calm environments where introverts can manage information, organize materials, and assist people in more controlled, one-on-one settings.
